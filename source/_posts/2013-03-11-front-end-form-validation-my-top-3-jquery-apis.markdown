<h3><em> - my top 3 JQuery APIs</em></h3>

Last week, we had <a href="http://jonathangrover.com/">Jonathan Grover</a> guest lecture us for a week on Javascript and JQuery.

It was a really interesting week during which we learnt how useful Javascript is in improving the user interface and experience, how JQuery resolves issues around Javascript cross-browser compatibility, and applied Javascript and JQuery in many contexts, including interacting with Twitter, Flickr and Google Maps APIs.

One of the practical applications of Javascript / JQuery was in form validations, which we combined with back-end Rails validation. While back-end validation is used to ensure data integrity, front-end validation is used to provide end-users with timely feedback to create a more positive user-experience.
