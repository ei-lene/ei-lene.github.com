Starting from zero.

Avi gave a talk on the History of Code at today, and one of the programmers he quoted was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall">Larry Wall</a>, who once said, tongue-in-cheek, that: 
<blockquote>The three chief virtues of a programmer are: Laziness, Impatience and Hubris.</blockquote>
On that basis, I definitely qualify! ;)
